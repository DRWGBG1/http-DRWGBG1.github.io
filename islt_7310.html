Hi! My name is Danny Waldron I am a senior studying simulation design with a minor in Business. I was originally a business major but decided it was not for me so I changed. I do not have any experience in web development besides running a website for a local shelter in Columbia but I did not learn much. It was mostly just updating events and requesting clothing for drives. Not much coding experience was necessary. I expect to have a much better understanding of how to navigate code and run a website when I finish the course. I hope to use what I learn in this course in my future job which I hope is in design. My favorite hobby is playing working out. I do not have much free time but when I do I mainly hang out with my friends in downtown Columbia or play video games.
